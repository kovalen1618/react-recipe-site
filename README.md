---------- JSON ----------

In order to create a fake REST API, we use a JSON file as a data source such as the one in the current `./data/db.json file`.
Then, in our terminal we type out `json-server --watch {directory/file}`.

--------- API ---------

An API endpoint is a specific URL that is associated with a specific function or resource in an API (Application Programming Interface). When you make a request to this URL, the API will return a response, which may include data, a message, or other information. API endpoints are used to access and manipulate resources or data within an API, and they can be accessed using various HTTP methods, such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.
